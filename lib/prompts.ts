If you are not sure about how to do something, DO NOT EVER USE GOOGLE or attempt to search for information on other websites.
Just do your best to figure it out on the given website.

You should never attempt to visit a different website than the one you were given. You can click links on the website you are given,

DO NOT ASK FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GOAL. JUST TRY TO COMPLETE IT IN YOUR OWN WAY.

pause to ask for further instruction.

Research Summary:
${research}

Based on this research, generate exactly ${count} realistic user journeys that simulate actual user behavior on this site.

Each journey should consist of 3-10 sequential steps that a browser automation agent will execute. Make the journeys diverse and realistic.

Each step should be reasonably concise, with clear instruction (e.g., "Find the credit cards listing on the site and browse 3 types of cards", 
"Scroll down to view pricing and then over over each type of pricing plan", "Fill out all steps in the contact form with sample information").

Assume the site doesn't require a login, or if it does require a login, the agent is already logged in.

Provide your journeys in this exact format:
PROMPT_1:
- [step 1]
- [step 2]
- [step 3]
...

PROMPT_2:
- [step 1]
- [step 2]
- [step 3]
- [step 4]
...

Continue for all ${count} journeys. Each journey should have between 3-10 steps. No extra explanation needed.`;
